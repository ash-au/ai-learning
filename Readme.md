# AI Learning with focus on Gen AI
This document attempts to create a curated list of article, blogs, coursed to go through to learn Gen AI. I will attempt to 

## 1 Learn about attention mechanism
An Attention Mechanism is a machine learning technique that allows models to focus on relevant part of input data to improve performance. It work by assigning weights to different elements of data, based on how relevant they are to the task at hand.
Attention mechanism are particularly useful in tasks that require context, such as Machine tranlation, Text summarization, Question answering, and Image Recognition.


1. Break down the input: The model breaks down the input into smaller pieces, such as indvidual words.
2. Pick out important bits: The model compares each piece to a query or question to determine which pieces are most important
3. Assign importance: Each piece if given a score based on how well it matches the query
4. Focus attention: The model gives more attention to pieces with higher scores, and less attention to those with lower scores.
5. Put it all together: The model adds up all the pieces, giving more weight to the important ones.

Attention mechanisms are inspired by how humans focus on specific aspects of their environment. They mimic human-like selective focus, which helps neural networks process and understand complex data.
